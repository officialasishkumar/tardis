  summary: Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python
  description: |
    The typing module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5, but
    many new features have been added to the module since then.
    This means users of older Python versions who are unable to upgrade will not be
    able to take advantage of new types added to the ``typing`` module, such as
    typing.Protocol or typing.TypedDict.

    The typing_extensions module contains both backports of these changes
    as well as experimental types that will eventually be added to the typing
    module, such as Protocol.
